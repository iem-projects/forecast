The origin in the choice of Forum Stadtpark for the exhibition that was eventually titled "Turbulence" lay in another research project, "Klangräume" by Georgios Marentakis and David Pirrò. That project investigates the potentials and limitations of applying evaluation strategies normally found in design contexts to the production of sound art works. I am using this blog as a means to answer a number of questions posed by "Klangräume", documenting the process through which "Turbulence" came into being.

## Intention

<!--
If possible, formulate your intention and motivation.
Were there any things that acted as inspiration?
Was there an "aim" you wanted to achieve?
Was there a "starting point" to this work?
-->

A good number of paragraphs that may elucidate questions surrounding "intention" and "inspiration" may be found in the essay I wrote for the brochure that we produced to accompagny the exhibition: {% extlink "Particularities and Generalities" https://www.academia.edu/9444622/Particularities_and_Generalities._Considerations_on_the_Sound_Composition %}.

I will first start with some thoughts about my sound works in general, before then defining the particularities of this installation. To save myself work, I will put a few quotes from my {% extlink PhD thesis http://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk:8080/pearl_xmlui/handle/10026.1/3116 %}:

> ... we find ourselves in a permanent struggle with the technology. We may have a certain
idea of what we are trying to achieve when using it, but it will always introduce a shift in what
is being produced which is inherent in the machine and not under control—neither the control
of the composer nor the control of the designer of the machine. It is often assumed that the
machine embodies a “service”, with ideas on two ends of a spectrum. On one end, an engineered
algorithm perfectly adhering to a design specification versus, on the other end, the idea of a
perfect model of the human cognitive capabilities that can be implanted into a machine which
thereby becomes transparent “support”. These ideas need not be dismissed, but they ignore the
possibility that an experimental system arises from the friction between human composer and
machine. [pp. 3--4]


## Experience

<!--
Describe how an ideal visitor would experience the installation.
What experiences you wish the visitor to have?
How do you expect the (sound) material to be perceived and interpreted?
How do you expect visitors to experience interaction within the installation?
-->

## Development

<!--
Describe the development process you followed and if possible provide us with a high-level diagram of the process.
How did you work? Did you follow a specific Methodology?

- If you consider the development process as a series of decisions among different design choices, explain why specific decisions were made.
  Outline the questions (issues) that arose during development and explain the specific decisions that were made in response to these questions
  including both artistic and technical aspects.
-->

## Context

<!--
Place the installation into context.
Provide us with references to past or present technological, artistic or scientific works that you think build to the context of the work you are presenting
-->

## Technology

<!--
Provide us with a detailed technical description of the installation.
-->

## Evaluation

<!--
Did you (if yes How?) assess if the installation "works"?
What does it mean to you that the installation "works"?
Do you consider your installation finished?
Are there aspects you want to develop further?
-->

<!--
Outcome of evaluation process
What do you expect or wish to learn from the evaluation process?
Are there any aspects of your installation which you wish the evaluation process would help you to understand better?
-->

## Materials

<!--
Provide us with any documentation material relevant to the installation other then text: photos, videos, audio recordings etc.
Preferably from different development stages.
