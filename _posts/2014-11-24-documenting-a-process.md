The origin in the choice of Forum Stadtpark for the exhibition that was eventually titled "Turbulence" lay in another research project, "Klangräume" by Georgios Marentakis and David Pirrò. That project investigates the potentials and limitations of applying evaluation strategies normally found in design contexts to the production of sound art works. I am using this blog as a means to answer a number of questions posed by "Klangräume", documenting the process through which "Turbulence" came into being.

## Intention

<!--
If possible, formulate your intention and motivation.
Were there any things that acted as inspiration?
Was there an "aim" you wanted to achieve?
Was there a "starting point" to this work?
-->

A good number of paragraphs that may elucidate questions surrounding "intention" and "inspiration" may be found in the essay I wrote for the brochure that we produced to accompany the exhibition: {% extlink "Particularities and Generalities" https://www.academia.edu/9444622/Particularities_and_Generalities._Considerations_on_the_Sound_Composition %}.

I will first start with some thoughts about my sound works in general, before then defining the particularities of this installation. To save myself work, I will put a few quotes from my {% extlink PhD thesis http://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk:8080/pearl_xmlui/handle/10026.1/3116 %}:

> [...] we find ourselves in a permanent struggle with the technology. We may have a certain
idea of what we are trying to achieve when using it, but it will always introduce a shift in what
is being produced which is inherent in the machine and not under control—neither the control
of the composer nor the control of the designer of the machine. It is often assumed that the
machine embodies a “service”, with ideas on two ends of a spectrum. On one end, an engineered
algorithm perfectly adhering to a design specification versus, on the other end, the idea of a
perfect model of the human cognitive capabilities that can be implanted into a machine which
thereby becomes transparent “support”. These ideas need not be dismissed, but they ignore the
possibility that an experimental system arises from the friction between human composer and
machine. [...]<br>
> Naturally, a setting is given; for example, when I plan to make a sound installation in a particular
space, the space and the situation are given, and you have to write a proposal or outline of what
you are going to do, which materials and resources you will need to allocate, etc. But they
remain hypotheses for the sake of getting started. If there is a form plan, it is just a frame inside
which the experimentation happens. [...]<br>
> As audience, I very much prefer to visit a sound installation than to attend a concert. I explain this by the
possibility of non-theatrality which allows me to define my own unrolling of a piece or situation
in time. There must always be an element of non-narrativity. [pp.&nbsp;3--4]

So while it is correct to say that there were a number of starting points---the SysSon project, sonification, 
the climate data sets...---they are not necessarily my "movitation", that what animates my work. For example, the
exhibition space was a huge motivation in the first place; the prospect of being pervaded by a
spatial sound structure suspended within this beautiful space with its glass façade, a sound structure
that reveals something about the clash between ideas brought from the outside and the technology that
I have been developing for quite some time (the computer music system, the sonification platform).

There are also "aims" that can be better understood as _guidelines_. For instance, the thematic of the
installation---to make perceivable something as complex as climate phenomena which by their definition
do not occur within a scale amounting to our individual sensation of our immediate environment.
Understood as a guideline, that means that if---by whatever means---in the eventual exhibition there
are elements that evoke a sensation that someone connects to their abstract conception of "climate", then
we achieved something we aimed for. On the other hand, we have no guarantee of such evocation, because
I do not believe that my own experience necessarily reflects that of any other visitor of the show,
nor would this evocation be something that we could _really_ have designed.

When I create an installation, I always want to create a space that permits someone to spend their time
inside, offering certain ways to perceive sounds, rhythms, shapes, trajectories. If someone enjoys
spending their time there, letting their thoughts wander around and make tiny connections, then I
think the work has succeeded.

Apart from these considerations, there is also a very manifest technological motivation in this work.
I have built _SoundProcesses_, the software on top of which the SysSon platform operates, for many years
now, and only recently it became mature enough to run a sound installation. In my works "Voice Trap" and "Dots" (2012)
it was used for the first time, but it was far from complete, and there were many things that I could
not do at that time, and many other things which have changed since then. With _SoundProcesses_ I want
to build an environment that blurs the boundaries between electroacoustic composition, sound installation
and live improvisation. For me, _SoundProcesses_ has become a body of questions relating to the
representation of musical material, the flow of time, the process of composition, the nature of algorithms
and so forth. It is my epistemic apparatus so to speak. So advancing that apparatus, experimenting with
a specific sub-set of these questions is a strong motivation in this project.

## Experience

<!--
Describe how an ideal visitor would experience the installation.
What experiences you wish the visitor to have?
How do you expect the (sound) material to be perceived and interpreted?
How do you expect visitors to experience interaction within the installation?
-->

Curiously, the questionaire only talks about the experience that _I wish "an ideal visitor" would have_. It is thus
more a question about expectation that about experience. I will nevertheless use "experience" as the headline and complete
the expectation part with my own actual experience.

### Expectation

I do not hide the fact that my ideal visitor shares a significant amount of traits with myself; after all, I want to create
a work that I am convinced of myself, that pleases my own aesthetical sense. Humans may have extremely different
experiences and backgrounds, but still we know that we share values with other individuals---the individuals we value.
We all know the famous quote by Saint-Exupéry: "Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction." So I imagine that a person that values the work at least occasionally looks into the
same, or approximately same direction as myself.

But then experience is the process-form in natura. Experiences are becomings, and we have people to _make_ experiences.
So I think there are two components to this question. The first concerns the preconditions I consider relevant, the
other the possibilities of change. As a precondition, I think you ought to be a sensitive person, and my experience is
that this is a general condition independent of the type of sense (i.e. you need not be necessarily someone that is
very good with their hearing sense in particular).

It is difficult to write about the expectation at a point when the exhibition is already running for 2 1/2 weeks,
because I will retroactively shape what we _have done_ into something that can be experienced. So I have to force
myself to be artificially vague here. I think I would have wanted the visitor to be able to engage with some form
of technological interactivity that is subtle in the sense that it requires softness. In the programme notes I
used the formulation of "modulating the space" and I think that if someone would have an experience of
modulating the space (whatever one understands by the term of modulation), this would be what I wish for.

I wish for visitors to explore the space, to walk around and understand that the sound they hear is equally
produced by my composition and their movement in the space (not only in terms of activating sensors, but
also purely in acoustical terms, and even further in terms of their focus of attenation, the cross-modulation
by the light and space). I wish for people to connect to thoughts and fragments in their memory that they had
forgotten about, to bring some to the surface and allow them to be transformed by the installation.

Furthermore, I have long imagined that there must be some way in which a spatially extended sound environment
could provide for a particular form of co-presence, i.e. for the possibility to perceptually or mentally
decompose a complex object and be able to understand its components as present with each other, but individually
distinguishable, reproducing some form of spatial extension or texture in the mind. I imagined that the
sonification of a multi-channel data set would be an appropriate material to develop such a texture.
